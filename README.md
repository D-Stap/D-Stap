## 🚀 Recent projects

### [Cloud Resume](https://github.com/D-Stap/Cloud-Resume) | [Live](https://dafantestapletonresume.link)
Serverless resume site built with AWS. Started as a learning project, turned into something I actually maintain and improve.

**Stack:** S3 + CloudFront + API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB  
**IaC:** AWS SAM templates  
**Features:** Custom domain, visitor counter, automated deployments

### [IAM Privilege Checker](https://github.com/D-Stap/iam-privilege-checker)
Python CLI for analyzing IAM policies. Got tired of manually reviewing policies for wildcards and dangerous permissions, so I built this.

**What it does:** Scans JSON policies, flags risky patterns, suggests improvements  
**Usage:** Can run standalone or integrate into CI pipelines

### [AWS Secure Environment](https://github.com/D-Stap/aws-secure-env)
Terraform modules for setting up secure AWS infrastructure. Collection of patterns I use regularly.

**Components:** VPC setup, security groups, logging configuration  
**Focus:** Security baselines, compliance-ready configurations

### [Security Evidence Collector](https://github.com/D-Stap/security-evidence-collector)
Tool that runs multiple security scanners and normalizes the output. Useful for compliance reporting and tracking security posture over time.

**Integration:** Checkov, tfsec, Semgrep, custom scanners  
**Output:** Structured reports, baseline comparisons

### [Security Pipeline](https://github.com/D-Stap/security-pipeline)
GitHub Actions workflows for automated security scanning. Template for integrating security checks into development workflows.

**Coverage:** Infrastructure code, container images, application code  
**Approach:** Fail fast on security issues, detailed reporting
