## 🚀 Recent projects

### [Cloud Resume](https://github.com/D-Stap/Cloud-Resume) | [Live](https://dafantestapletonresume.link)
Serverless resume site built with AWS. Started as a learning project, turned into something I actually maintain and improve.

**Stack:** S3 + CloudFront + API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB.  
**IaC:** AWS SAM templates.  
**Features:** Custom domain, visitor counter, automated deployments.

### [IAM Privilege Checker](https://github.com/D-Stap/iam-privilege-checker)
Python CLI for analyzing IAM policies. Got tired of manually reviewing policies for wildcards and dangerous permissions, so I built this.

**What it does:** Scans JSON policies, flags risky patterns, suggests improvements.  
**Usage:** Can run standalone or integrate into CI pipelines.

### [AWS Secure Environment](https://github.com/D-Stap/aws-secure-env)
Terraform modules for setting up secure AWS infrastructure. Collection of patterns I use regularly.

**Components:** VPC setup, security groups, logging configuration.  
**Focus:** Security baselines, compliance-ready configurations.

### [Terraform Modules](https://github.com/D-Stap/terraform-modules)
Reusable AWS infrastructure components with security and cost optimization built in.  

**Components:** ECR repositories, S3 buckets, Cognito user pools, VPC security groups and continuing to add more.
**Focus:** Environment-aware retention, encryption by default, developer productivity.
